# Final-30-Project
This is a first person shooter game made in Unity for the computer science course culminating.

# Resources I Used
Game engine https://unity.com/

Multiplayer solution https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/fish-net-networking-evolved-207815

Skybox https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/sci-fi/real-stars-skybox-lite-116333 GitHub didnâ€™t allow me to push cubemapfiles to my repository, so if you want to edit the code with the sky box you would need to download and import the asset from the link.

Futuristic Textures https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/futuristic-panel-textures-lite-80176

I followed this playlist and there is even a tutorial on a multiplayer FPS in it which I used to make my code for the Unity game.
